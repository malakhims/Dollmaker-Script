Ophagirl Dollmaker Script
==========================

Hi!! I didn't make the original scripts for this. 

It's originally from Ninique and I heavily edited another fork called Dollmaker NEO that didn't work for me out of the box 
and had some weird bugs!! 

I thought the instructions in the original files could be a bit confusing, so I tried to simplify them. I commented through the code in the index files just for you!

This script works with PHP originally but for static sites, it works with JavaScript too.

I am using the following libraries/plugins (The javascript libraries are
hosted from Google):  
---------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS

- Images uploading in bases will be one of the default skin tones.

- (You could technically not use this at all and have the bodies be placeable if you want, but I found it to be kind of a pain for my purposes this time, but it has a lot of potential for larger games)

PHP USERS

- If you have PHP, any subdirectory you make in the images directory will show up in the tabs. Make sure you trim the images for the final dollmaker so there's not a lot of space.

STATIC ONLY USERS 

- For those without PHP, this script will be annoying to maintain, 
but it can be set up still thanks to the original programmers of the fork and original code! 
They are so sweet. 

I put instructions in index.html. It's straightforward but a bit tedious as you have to define every image yourself. 
This is something neocities and other static hosting artists are pretty used to though. You have more patience than I
