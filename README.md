Ophagirl Dollmaker Template
==========================

Hi!! This is a heavily modified script! I didn't write all of it myself for those coming from off of github!! I just fixed a lot of broken code and updated old user code!! I redid a lot of the CSS
but some of the old stuff is still in there haha.

It's originally from Ninique and I heavily edited another fork called Dollmaker NEO that didn't work for me out of the box 
and had some weird bugs!! I thought the instructions in the original files could be a bit confusing, so I tried to simplify them. 
I commented through the code in the index files just for you!

This script works with PHP, but it works with JavaScript too so static hosts like Neocities can use this just fine.

INSTRUCTIONS

- You can right click Code at the top to install the zip!
- This can just be plopped in an existing site the way it is and the directory's name can be changed at any time, so make as many dollmakers as you want!! 
- Images uploading in bases will be one of the default skin tones.
- (You could technically not use this at all and have the bodies be placeable if you want, but I found it to be kind of a pain for my purposes this time, but it has a lot of potential for larger games)
- The template is ugly on purpose!! Edit the CSS and make it beautiful!! Put your SOUL INTO IT.

PHP USERS
- Delete index.html
- If you have PHP, any subdirectory you make in the images directory will show up in the tabs. Make sure you trim the images for the final dollmaker so there's not a lot of space.

STATIC ONLY USERS 

- Delete index.php
- For those without PHP, this script will be annoying to maintain,  but it can be set up still thanks to the original programmers of the fork and original code! They are so sweet. 
- I put instructions in index.html. It's straightforward but a bit tedious as you have to define every image yourself.  This is something neocities and other static hosting artists are pretty used to though. You have more patience than I

I couldn't do this without those original people so thank you!!!
